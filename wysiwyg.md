# Text editors (**wysiwyg**)

## [TinyMCE](http://www.tinymce.com/)
_please dont_ ...

### version 3.x

#### CONS
* themes are bad
* in FF, for more that 1 instance of tinymce, only first is loaded

#### PROS
* advanced theme, despise being bad overall, is nicely customizable, so you can throw away all the not needed buttons

### version 4.x

#### CONS
* in FF, buttons are not loaded (wat)

#### PROS
* better themes than in 3.x

## [CKEditor](http://ckeditor.com/)

**DO NOT** use it or even think about it

## [Wysihtml5](http://xing.github.io/wysihtml5/)

**Ugly**

## [Redactor](http://imperavi.com/redactor/)

### PROS
* pretty.damn.awesome

### Cons
* needs $$$

## [PageDown](https://code.google.com/p/pagedown/)

### PROS
* used on stack overflow, so highly checked solution
* [custom gem for rails](https://github.com/rh/pagedown-rails)
* [integrated with bootstrap](https://github.com/hughevans/pagedown-bootstrap-rails)

### CONS
* needs assets pipeline (so not really a con, 'cause you should use assets pipeline as a must)

## VERDICT

Do not use wysiwyg overall :) But if you really, really have to, PageDown seems to be your best choice for free.
If you want to spend some $$$, go for Redactor without hesitation.
