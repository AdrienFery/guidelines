## Contribution to this repository

According to [this issue](https://github.com/monterail/rules/issues/25) we agreed to:

* Declare if he/she wants to participate in issues tagged with given word, for example #ruby or #css. Then all issues / pull-request would be tagged appropriately.
* If so, he/she would be obligated to comment on issue or at least give +1 or no opinion comment for example until week after issue has been created.
* The idea is subscribed persons would be obligated to comment. We will mention them in such cases.
* Final decision for merging is for CTO.
* It's of course possible for non-declared person to participate. That list would help us determine if issue is ready to be accepted or it needs more discussion / time (for example if everyone would vote "no opinion").

Here is current list of tags along their participants:

* #ruby - @jandudulski, @sheerun, @chytreg, @teamon, @szajbus, @Ostrzy
* #js - @jandudulski, @sheerun, @chytreg, @szajbus, @porada, @Ostrzy
