# Ruby guidelines

* Consider using `Hash#fetch` instead of `Hash#[]`.

  The first one throws exception where it fails to read a key.
  In the second case we usually get `undefined method ... for nil:NilClass`
  somewhere else in the code. The first one is better for debug.

* Use of new ruby hash syntax for new projects.

  Use old syntax only when necessary, for example to put non-symbol as a key.
